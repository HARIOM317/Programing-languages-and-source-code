/*
  As we discussed earlier, Dart String is a sequence of characters, letters, numbers, and unique characters. It is the sequence of UTF - 16 Unicode characters where Dart Runes are the sequence UTF - 32 Unicode code points. It is a UTF-32 string which is used to print the special symbol. For example - The theta (Î˜) symbol is signified by using the corresponding Unicode equivalent \u0398; here '\u' refers to Unicode, and the numbers are in the hexadecimal. Sometimes the hex digits are the more than 4 digits then it should be placed in curly brackets ({}).
