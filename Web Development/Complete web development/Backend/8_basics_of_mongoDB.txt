* What is Document Oriented database?
Ans - MongoDB stores data as documents, so it is known as document oriented database.

ex.- 
contact document{
    _id: <ObjectId2>,
    user_id: <ObjectId1>,
    phone: "123-456-7890",
    email: "xyz@example.com"
}

RDBMS vs MongoDB:

* Database - Database
* tables - Collections
* Rows - Documents
________________________________________________________________

Note :
1. mongod is the host process for the database.
2. mongo is the command-line shell that connects to a specific instance of mongod.
3. When you run mongo with no parameters it defaults to connecting to the localhost on port 27017.
4. If you run mongo against an invalid host_machine:port combination then it will fail to connect.
5. mongo automatically store and save the data of database in directory which command we run. it means we can access our data after closing the server/ restart the server also.
________________________________________________________________

Note: Add the path of mongo-shell and mongod (bin folder) in environment variable.

Note: MongoShell should be connected from mongod to use all commands and create database.

for connecting to each-other:
step-1: Open powerShell and type "mongod"
step-2: Open powerShell again in another window and type "mongo"

Now both are connected.
