Former India captain Virat Kohli received a rousing reception as he came to bat during Day 1 of the second and final Test of the series against Sri Lanka on Saturday. The side is taking on Dimuth Karunaratne's men in the pink-ball Test – India's third at home – in Bengaluru. The city is Kohli's ‘second home’, as the 33-year-old has been representing the Royal Challengers Bangalore franchise since the inception of the Indian Premier League in 2008.
